📊 Through compelling visualizations, I've delved into various aspects of the 𝐄𝐕 landscape, including total vehicle counts, average electric range, and the distribution between 𝐁𝐄𝐕 and 𝐏𝐇𝐄𝐕 vehicles. From dynamic graphs showcasing total vehicles by 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫 to detailed breakdowns by 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 , this analysis offers a comprehensive view of the evolving 𝐄𝐕 market.

🏆 Additionally, I've identified the top 10 vehicle makes dominating the 𝐄𝐕 space and their contributions to meeting 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐅𝐮𝐞𝐥 𝐄𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐲 (𝐂𝐀𝐅𝐄)
standards. By examining vehicles eligible for 𝐂𝐀𝐅𝐄 credits and unveiling the most popular models over time, this project provides actionable insights into consumer preferences and industry trends.
